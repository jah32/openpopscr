\format{An object of class \code{R6ClassGenerator} of length 24.}
\usage{
JsModel
}
\description{
Jolly-Seber model: fits model, formats inference, and 
simulates from fitted model. 
\itemize{
  \item form: a named list of formulae for each parameter (~1 for constant)
  \item scr_data: a ScrData object 
  \item start: a named list of starting values 
  \item print (defualt = TRUE): if TRUE then helpful output is printed to the screen
}

Methods include: 
\itemize{
 \item get_par(name, j, k, m): returns value of parameter "name" for detector j 
  on occasion k (if j, k omitted then returns value(s) for all)
 \item set_par(par): can change the parameter the model uses. Note, the model will simulate 
   data using this parameter, but will only present inference based on the maximum likelihood
   estimates. 
 \item set_mle(mle, V, llk): set maximum likleihood for this model with parameters mle, 
 covariance matrix V, and maximum likelihood value llk
 \item calc_D_llk(): computes the likelihood of the D parameter
 \item calc_initial_distribution(): computes initial distribution over life states (unborn, alive, dead)
 \item calc_pr_entry(): computes vector with entry j equal to probability of individual unborn up to occasion j
 being born just after occasion j
 \item calc_tpms(): returns list of transition probability matrix for each occasion 
 \item calc_pr_capture(): returns array where (i,k,m) is probability of capture record 
 on occasion k for individual i given activity centre at mesh point m
 \item calc_pdet(): compute probability of being detected at least once during the survey
 \item calc_llk(): compute log-likelihood at current parameter values 
 \item fit(): fit the model by obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates. Estimates of
       density are obtained from parametric boostrap with nsim resamples. 
 \item simulate(): simulate ScrData object from fitted model
 \item par(): return current parameter of the model 
 \item mle(): return maximum likelihood estimates for the fitted model 
 \item data(): return ScrData that the model is fit to 
 \item estimates(): return estimates in a easy to extract list 
 \item cov_matrix(): return variance-covariance matrix from fitted model (on working scale)
 \item mle_llk(): return log-likelihood value of maximum likelihood estimates
